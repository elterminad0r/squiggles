# squiggles
A squiggle generator in Python processing. Works by generating a square tesselation of "tiles" which each have two quarter circles at opposing corners, with radius half the base of the square, such that an arc ends at each midpoint of a square edge. These tiles are then randomly rotated. It "walks" between two orientations. It looks like this at the start:
